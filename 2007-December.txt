Subject: [Portpkg-announce] ANNOUNCE: portpkg-0.38.5
Message-ID: <1196948775l.6481l.0l@localhost>

Released portpkg-0.38.5:
 * Fixed maintainer mode hang.
 * Fixed wrong timestamps.
 * Fixed defaulting to proper umask.
 * Dependencies are now checked before doing anything (resulting in a
 reasonable and complete list of what to do and what options to
 consider).

As usual updates are available as source package (.tar.bz2) via "make 
install", as Slackware package (.tgz) via "installpkg"/"upgradepkg" or 
in ports via "portpkg --sync; portpkg portpkg":
